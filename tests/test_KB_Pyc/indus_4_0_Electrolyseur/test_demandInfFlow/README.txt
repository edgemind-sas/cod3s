Description : 
Testing an infinite flow demand with a battery and an electrical source.
The export demand ends when the battery is full.

Expected values:
- v_flow_out of the electrical source goes from its nominal value to 0.
- v_content of the battery increases until it reaches its maximum capacity.
- The battery's export demand goes to 0.
