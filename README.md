# COD3S: COmplex Dynamic Stochastic System Simulation library

COD3S aims to provide tools for building generic component libraries to model complex industrial systems for simulation and assessment. The framework provides a generic formalism to describe components and systems, along with tools to translate system descriptions into other frameworks like PyCATSHOO to perform quantitative analyses.

## Key Features

- Generic component and system modeling formalism
- Tools for translating system descriptions to simulation frameworks
- Support for PyCATSHOO integration for quantitative analyses
- Framework for building reusable component libraries
